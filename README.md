# Module 9 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application
In this project, we've coaborated and built an app that provides users with an estimated amount of CO2 emissions for trips between any two cities of the world. 
It also provides current/forecast weather conditions for the destination city.
This will make people aware of the impact they can have on environment, and this way they can make a better choice after comparing the calculated CO2 emissions.

Requirements:
*Use Bootstrap.
*Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
*Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
*Use at least two server-side APIs.
*Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
*Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
*Be responsive.
*Have a polished UI.

*Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

*Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
## "Travel planner - location and what you can do around that area" 
Project description: 

This app leverages two distinct API’s to enable users to access and evaluate the carbon footprint as a result of their 
travel. Through the platform, users can search for a destination and preferred mode of travel, allowing them to see 
how much C02 has been produced. 
Additionally, users can also access information regarding the weather conditions 
at their destination. The site offers comparative data relating to the C02 emitted by separate modes of travel, along 
with real-time weather forecasts and analytical tools to keep users informed and up to date.
     This project makes use of two API’s, allowing the user to view the carbon cost of their travel. Users are able to 
search for their detination and mode of travel to find out exactly how much C02 that journey would produce. Users 
will also be given information on the weather at their detination  be able to see the true effect they have on the 
environment. The site offer C02 comparisons between types of travel, the ability to view weather forecasts at their 
deestination of choice, providing the user with up to date information and analytics.

In terms of user interface, there are 2 user input and 2 search buttons, where users can input starting location and destination, transportation type and accomodation options.
The user could enter the start and end citis they want to travel to and the app wreturns estimate CO2 emissions for their trip by calculating the amount of CO2 emissions, as well as the weather forecast.

When a user searches for a trip from one city to another, they are presented with current and future weather conditions for the destination city and the search results are added to the search history;
When a user views the current available information for that city they are presented with:
*The city name
*The current date
*The weather conditions
*The estimated CO2 emissions for the trip  to the searched place
*The time it takes to get there at a certain time (depending on traffic conditions, weather or any events happenig)
*The things that would be recommended to see in or around that location

*When a user clicks on a trip in the search history they are again presented with th eresults for that trip.

## Activities covered
Discussed and decided on what the app should do
Created a share document where we can add ideas and sugestions;

Created the folder structure 
Link the css and js script with the index.html file;
Add the required link tags in html file;
Created issues and branchef for different elements that would be then merged into main branch;
Researched a lot of server APIs, until we decided what we want our app to do.
We have chosen Travel CO2 and Open weather server APIs.
In terms of technology, we've been using the server APIs mentioned above, web API Momentum, Bootstrap framework, and of course HTML, CSS and javascript.
