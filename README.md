## "Travel planner - location and what you can do around that area" 
Project description: 

The app allows users to plan their travels by creating an itinerary of places they want to visit. 
The user could enter the start and end dates of the trip, the city they are traveling to, and a list of places they want to visit. The app would then use the Google Maps API to display a map of the city and plot the user's itinerary. 
The app would use the Foursquare Places API to retrieve information about each location, including photos, reviews, and contact information. The app would also provide travel time and directions between each location, as well as recommendations for nearby restaurants and other attractions.
This app would be useful for travelers who want to plan their trips in advance, or for anyone who wants to create a customized itinerary for a trip. 
It would help users save time and ensure they see all the sights and attractions they want to visit, without missing anything important.

When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history;
When a user views the current available information for that city they are presented with:
*The city name
*The current date
*The weather conditions
*The route to the searched place
*The time it takes to get there at a certain time (depending on traffic conditions, weather or any events happenig)
*The things that would be recommended to see in or around that location

*When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
